The Banane WWW Documentation


All routines need the varaiable 
BANANEPATH="/home/groups/banane/htdocs/wwwcopy/Banane"
to be set to the appropriate value.



$BANANEPATH/Documentation/Perl/.

./updatemain.pl: Main Perl script that uses the output of SVN update
to determine which routines have been changed. The headers of these
routines are parsed and the result is used to update the mySQL
database.

./parseupdate.pm: Perl module that contains the grammar and a function
to parse the output of SVN update, i.e. to determine paths and filenames of
routines that have been comitted since the last update.

./parseheader.pm: Perl module containing the grammar to parse the file
header. Returns the sections of the header as a hash that can be used
as input to the mySQL database.



$BANANEPATH/Documentation/Scripts/.

./wwwupdate.scr: executes svn update of Banane working copy at the
berlios web server and calls
$BANANEPATH/Documentation/Perl/parse_update.pl to update the database.

./wwwdocu_conf.scr: Script that return the appropriate values of
local values, e.g. mySQL server and user. This is done via the echo
command to ensure that both PERL- and PHP-Scripts can use this info. May be extended for other
"global" settings.



$BANANEPATH/Documentation/PHP/.
./viewroutine.php: Generates Webpage for a single routine from mySQL
database. Parameter is the name of the routine, this can be passed as
the first argument like viewroutine.php?kwextract

./viewdir.php: Generates Webpage that displays a table with columns
routine name and aim, for a quick overview. Selects all routines in
the directory and subdirectories given as the first argument of the
script call. Example:
http://banane.berlios.de/wwwcopy/Banane/Documentation/PHP/viewdir.php?/home/groups/banane/htdocs/wwwcopy/Banane/
This feature may be used to restrict the number of routines shown.



DATABASE:
mySQL database banane, presently at db.berlios.de. Access with
mysql -h db.berlios.de -u banane -p banane
Enter password: TIpKEPc26U

Primary table "routines" initialized with command
CREATE TABLE routines (name VARCHAR(128), aim VARCHAR(128),
description VARCHAR(1024), category VARCHAR(512), PRIMARY KEY(name));

Added other colums later:
ALTER TABLE routines ADD fullpath VARCHAR(128) AFTER name;
ALTER TABLE routines ADD version VARCHAR(128) AFTER fullpath;
ALTER TABLE routines ADD proc VARCHAR(512) AFTER restrictions;
etc...

Secondary table "inputs" initialized with
CREATE TABLE inputs (name VARCHAR(128), argument VARCHAR(128),
description VARCHAR(1024), PRIMARY KEY(argument));
Create tables optinputs and outputs analoguously.

Tables are connected via "name" that uniquely
identifies the routines. Multiple inputs to the same routine can be
inserted in the inputs table repeating the name of the routine.



Regular update of the database with cronjob, since post-commit script
does not allow execution of arbitrary scripts. 

Command to edit crontab: crontab -e. 

Call wwwupdate.scr explicitely., since it cannot know the path.

Crontab looks like this

SHELL=/bin/bash
MAILTO=andreas.thiel@gmail.com

TO DO
- include possibility to delete a file. Action "D" in svn update
- include sections "AUTHOR" and "DATE CREATED" in header
- write script to completely update the database, i.e. parse every
file
- Separate root bananepath and path to routine relative to root and
maybe filename as well. In general, optimze directory handling, try to
ommit path to repository
- make the $id$ tag work in svn: Command works only on single
routines: svn propset svn:keywords "Id" kwextract.m but at least acts
for the wwwcopy as well
- evoke bananeblog
- automatically mail commits to the blog
- verbatim printing of %* header lines: At persent, only line breaks
are inserted. Enable possibility of mixing verbatim and non-verbatim
lines.
- put Documentation under version control
- nicer concatenation of strings in parseheader
- try out if mssing optional header sections like "restrictions" etc
work properly.
