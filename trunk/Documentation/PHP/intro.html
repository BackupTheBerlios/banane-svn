    <P>The banane project is a collection of <A
	HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/"
	TARGET="_blank">MATLAB</A> routines for
    processing, analyis and visualization of neurophysiological data,
    in particular multiple sequences of action potentials, as are
    commonly recorded with multielectrode arrays.

    <P>Click on the directory names on the right to view a list of routines
    contained in the respective directory. You may also search for the
    name of a routine. 

    <P>Presently, the collection of routines is incomplete and under
    construction, so be sure to check back frequently. For the latest
